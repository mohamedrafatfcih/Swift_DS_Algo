# Common Non-Premitive Data Structures (DS).
  - Introduced (stack, queue, linked list, ....) DS that are commonly known and used in many cases in our apps.
  - Provided example cases that should be close enough to the real world situations which trigger the need for building such DS.
 
 ## Stack
  Example case:
  - Assume you want to read set of books and you put them in a reading list. Aslo, you want to keep their reading order to help you to get back quickly to the last read book.
 
 ## Queue
 Example case: 
 - Assume you are in metero station and you want to buy a ticket the so, you will go to one of the selling windows and wait at the end of the people line.
 
 ## Linked List
  - Notes :
      - It is linear data structre.
      - Every element is a node.
      - It uses head and tail nodes.
      - Quick insertion and deletion.
      - Adding new element will be through appending or insertion at a position.
      - Deleting element will be from the end (tail) or at a position.
      - You have to use classes for linked list because they are reference type which it needed for next reference.
  
  ### Single Linked List
   - Example Case: 
        - you have childern in a school class and you want to place them. Also you want to make each child know his next classmate.
  
  ### Double Linked List 
   - Example Case:
       - Assume that you have students in a class and you want to place them. Also, you want from each one to know who is his before and after classmates.
